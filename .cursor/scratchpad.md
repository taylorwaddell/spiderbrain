# SpiderBrain CLI Implementation Plan

## Background and Motivation

SpiderBrain is a tool designed to help users manage and navigate through their knowledge base by creating a graph of interconnected nodes. For the MVP, we're focusing on three core commands that provide the essential functionality: creating new nodes, searching the knowledge base, and exporting the graph.

## AI Implementation Plan

### Architecture Overview

1. Core Components:

   - `AIModel` interface for model abstraction
   - `OllamaModel` implementation for local Ollama models
   - `AIService` for managing model interactions
   - `TagGenerator` for AI-powered tag generation

# Error Analysis: Tag Generation Validation Error

## Background and Motivation

After fixing the model initialization issue, we're now encountering a tag validation error:

```
Failed to generate tags: TagError: Tag length must be between 2 and 50 characters
```

The error occurs because the AI model is returning a full sentence as a tag: "Here are some relevant tags that could be used for the given text:"

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. Root Cause:

   - The AI model is returning a descriptive sentence instead of actual tags
   - The tag extraction logic in `extractTags` is not properly handling the model's response format
   - The validation rules are correctly catching the invalid tag, but we need to improve the prompt and extraction

2. Code Flow:
   - TagGenerator builds a prompt asking for tags
   - Model returns a descriptive response instead of a list of tags
   - `extractTags` splits the response but doesn't filter out non-tag content
   - Validation fails on the first "tag" because it's actually a sentence

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. [x] Improve Tag Generation Prompt

   - Success Criteria: Model returns a clean list of tags without descriptive text
   - Dependencies: None
   - Implementation: Updated prompt to be more explicit about format requirements and added example format

2. [x] Enhance Tag Extraction
   - Success Criteria: Non-tag content is properly filtered out
   - Dependencies: None
   - Implementation: Added robust filtering to remove sentences, descriptive text, and invalid tags

## Project Status Board

- [x] Task 1: Improve Tag Generation Prompt
- [x] Task 2: Enhance Tag Extraction

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

I've completed both tasks:

1. Updated the prompt to be more explicit about the required format and added an example
2. Enhanced the tag extraction logic with robust filtering:
   - Removes leading special characters
   - Handles descriptive text after colons
   - Filters out sentences and common descriptive words
   - Enforces tag length limits
   - Removes spaces and invalid content

The changes should now:

- Guide the model to return clean, properly formatted tags
- Handle and filter out any unexpected response formats
- Ensure only valid tags are processed

Please test the changes by running the `spiderbrain n` command again. The tag generation should now work correctly.

## Lessons

- Be explicit in AI prompts about the expected response format
