# SpiderBrain CLI Implementation Plan

## Background and Motivation

SpiderBrain is a tool designed to help users manage and navigate through their knowledge base by creating a graph of interconnected nodes. For the MVP, we're focusing on three core commands that provide the essential functionality: creating new nodes, searching the knowledge base, and exporting the graph.

# Error Analysis: Tag Generation Validation Error

## Background and Motivation

After fixing the model initialization issue, we're now encountering a tag validation error:

```
Failed to generate tags: TagError: Tag length must be between 2 and 50 characters
```

The error occurs because the AI model is returning a full sentence as a tag: "Here are some relevant tags that could be used for the given text:"

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. Root Cause:

   - The AI model is returning a descriptive sentence instead of actual tags
   - The tag extraction logic in `extractTags` is not properly handling the model's response format
   - The validation rules are correctly catching the invalid tag, but we need to improve the prompt and extraction

2. Code Flow:
   - TagGenerator builds a prompt asking for tags
   - Model returns a descriptive response instead of a list of tags
   - `extractTags` splits the response but doesn't filter out non-tag content
   - Validation fails on the first "tag" because it's actually a sentence

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. [x] Improve Tag Generation Prompt

   - Success Criteria: Model returns a clean list of tags without descriptive text
   - Dependencies: None
   - Implementation: Updated prompt to be more explicit about format requirements and added example format

2. [x] Enhance Tag Extraction
   - Success Criteria: Non-tag content is properly filtered out
   - Dependencies: None
   - Implementation: Added robust filtering to remove sentences, descriptive text, and invalid tags

## Project Status Board

- [x] Task 1: Improve Tag Generation Prompt
- [x] Task 2: Enhance Tag Extraction

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

I've completed both tasks:

1. Updated the prompt to be more explicit about the required format and added an example
2. Enhanced the tag extraction logic with robust filtering:
   - Removes leading special characters
   - Handles descriptive text after colons
   - Filters out sentences and common descriptive words
   - Enforces tag length limits
   - Removes spaces and invalid content

The changes should now:

- Guide the model to return clean, properly formatted tags
- Handle and filter out any unexpected response formats
- Ensure only valid tags are processed

Please test the changes by running the `spiderbrain n` command again. The tag generation should now work correctly.

## Lessons

- Be explicit in AI prompts about the expected response format
- Add robust filtering for AI-generated content to handle unexpected responses
- Consider adding example responses in prompts to guide the model
- When working with AI-generated content, always validate and clean the output
- Use multiple layers of validation and filtering to ensure clean data

# Migration Plan: Switch to phi4-mini Model

## Background and Motivation

We need to switch from llama2 to phi4-mini for tag generation. The phi4-mini model is:

- Smaller (2.5 GB vs 3.8 GB)
- More recent
- Potentially better suited for our tag generation task

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. Current State:

   - Using llama2 model in AIService configuration
   - Model is configured in cli.ts
   - Tag generation is working with current prompt format

2. Required Changes:
   - Update model configuration in cli.ts
   - Potentially adjust prompt for phi4-mini's characteristics
   - Ensure model name handling still works with new model

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. [x] Update Model Configuration

   - Success Criteria: AIService is configured to use phi4-mini
   - Dependencies: None
   - Implementation: Modified cli.ts to use phi4-mini with appropriate parameters

2. [ ] Test and Adjust Prompt
   - Success Criteria: Tag generation works effectively with phi4-mini
   - Dependencies: Task 1
   - Implementation: Test current prompt with new model and adjust if needed

## Project Status Board

- [x] Task 1: Update Model Configuration
- [ ] Task 2: Test and Adjust Prompt

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

I've completed the first task:

1. Updated the model configuration to use phi4-mini
2. Adjusted the model parameters:
   - Set temperature to 0.7 for more creative tag generation
   - Set maxTokens to 1000 to ensure we have enough context
   - Removed llama2-specific parameters that aren't needed

The next step is to test the tag generation with the new model. Please run the `spiderbrain n` command with a test input to verify the changes. Based on the results, we may need to adjust the prompt or parameters.

## Lessons

- Keep model configurations in a single, easily modifiable location
- Design prompts to be model-agnostic when possible
- Consider model size and performance characteristics when selecting models
- Document model requirements and dependencies clearly
- Adjust model parameters based on the specific task requirements

## Detailed Analysis of Tag Generation Failures

### 1. Tag Generation Core Issues

- **Root Cause**: The AI service is not properly initialized in the tag generator
- **Evidence**:
  - Console log shows "AI service is undefined here"
  - Tag generation returns empty arrays
  - Model integration is not working as expected

### 2. Specific Test Failures Analysis

a. Tag Generation Tests:

- `should generate tags successfully`: Returns empty array instead of 3 tags
- `should handle empty content`: Returns empty array instead of 3 tags
- `should handle model errors`: Test passes (only one working)

b. Tag Formatting Tests:

- All formatting tests fail due to empty tag arrays
- Format logic is correct but not being reached
- Custom format handling is untested

c. Tag Filtering Tests:

- `should limit number of tags`: Empty array instead of 2 tags
- `should deduplicate tags`: Empty array instead of 2 tags
- Filtering logic is correct but not being reached

### 3. Implementation Issues

1. AI Service Integration:

   ```typescript
   const model = options.model || this.aiService.getModel();
   ```

   - AI service is not properly initialized
   - Model retrieval is failing
   - Need to ensure proper service initialization

2. Tag Extraction:

   ```typescript
   private extractTags(response: string): string[]
   ```

   - Current implementation is too strict
   - Filtering out valid tags
   - Need to improve tag extraction logic

3. Tag Processing:
   ```typescript
